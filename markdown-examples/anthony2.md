# Sermon: **“This Too Is for the Best”—Finding Comfort in Christ in the Face of Loss**

---

## Introduction

Beloved, today we gather with heavy hearts, sometimes carrying burdens that seem too much to bear. Many of us know the pain of loss, the ache of missing someone we love. I want to speak directly to that sorrow—a sorrow that is real, deep, and not easily set aside. Yet, in our brokenness, in our questioning, in our doubts, God draws near. And His Word offers us hope, comfort, and assurance.

There’s an ancient Jewish saying that echoes even into our own faith: **“Gam zu le tova”—“This too is for the best.”** How can we say that in the face of death? How can we believe it when our hearts are shattered?

Let’s listen to what the Lord says:

> “The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”  
> — Psalm 34:18

## 1. **God Sees Your Sorrow**

Do not believe for a moment that God is distant from your pain. He is right there, in the silence of your weeping, in the nights when sleep won’t come. The Lord is close—_closer than your very breath!_ When we are broken, He draws near, not away.

Isn’t it easy to feel alone in grief? To fear that our loved ones are lost, or that we are sinking in sadness? But listen! God is not offended by your questions. He entered our grief in Jesus Christ—He wept at the tomb of His friend Lazarus! God knows your sorrow and shares it.

## 2. **Casting Your Grief on Christ**

Scripture invites us:

> “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”  
> — 1 Peter 5:7

Grief isn’t something we must bear alone. Lay it before the Lord in prayer. Speak your fears, your doubts, your anguish. _He cares!_ He welcomes every sigh, every tear. And Jesus Himself understands—for He was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.”

## 3. **Hope in the Resurrection**

But friends, Christ has not only shared our death—He has conquered it!

> “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live...”  
> — John 11:25

Let that sink into your spirit! Death is not the world’s last word—Jesus Christ is! He has broken the grave. All who put their trust in Him receive _eternal_ life. When you wonder about your brother—place his destiny in the nail-scarred hands of Jesus, who desires that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4).

No, we do not know every heart. But we know the heart of God! And His heart is rich in mercy, abounding in grace.

## 4. **Nothing Can Separate Us from God's Love**

You fear you may be separated from your loved one forever. Yet the apostle Paul declares:

> “For I am sure that neither death nor life...nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  
> — Romans 8:38-39

Let the enemy of your soul be silenced! In Christ, nothing—not even death—can break the bond of God's love.

## 5. **Saved by Grace—Not Our Goodness**

Maybe you worry, “Was my brother good enough?” But the Gospel says:

> “By grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God...”—Ephesians 2:8-9

It’s not about our record. It’s not about perfect faith or perfect living—it’s about the perfect grace of Jesus Christ! Trust that your brother’s eternal future, and yours, are in hands more capable and compassionate than your own.

## 6. **All Things for Good—even This**

Even now, in your pain, God is at work for your good:

> “And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”  
> — Romans 8:28

All things—even grief, even unanswered questions—He takes and transforms. Sometimes, we must walk by faith and not by sight, trusting Him when the way is dark.

## 7. **Glorious, Eternal Hope**

Listen to the promise:

> “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more...for the former things have passed away.”  
> — Revelation 21:4

There will be a day—oh, praise God!—when mourning is gone, and joy is all that’s left. The Lord Himself will wipe every tear from your eyes.

## Call to Action

**1. Pour out your heart before God.**  
Do not hide your sorrow. God can handle your questions—bring them to Him. He welcomes your honesty and your brokenness.

**2. Entrust your brother to the mercy of Christ.**  
If you do not know the state of his soul, rest in God’s goodness. Jesus judges with compassion and with justice. He loves your brother more than you ever could.

**3. Embrace the hope of resurrection.**  
If you have not yet clung to Christ, do so now. Believe in Him—He is the resurrection and the life. His arms are open. Trust Him with your pain, your future, your eternity.

**4. Comfort others with the same comfort you have received.**  
Reach out to those who mourn. Share their burdens. Share with them the hope you find in Christ—even when all is dark.

## Closing Prayer

Gracious Father,  
Draw near to the brokenhearted today. Wrap your children in your loving arms. Let your peace descend where there is pain. We place our loved ones into your merciful, nail-scarred hands, trusting you for what we cannot control or understand. Fill us with hope in the resurrection, and keep our eyes fixed on the day when you make all things new. In Jesus’ name,  
**Amen.**

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.”  
> — John 5:24

_This too is for the best—because our hope is in Christ, and Christ is making all things new. Let us walk by faith and not by sight, until we are reunited, face-to-face, in His presence forever. Amen._
