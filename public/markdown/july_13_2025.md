# **Sermon: “Redeeming the Times—Living Purposefully in a Changing World”**

## _Pastor Mike, July 13, 2025_

### **Welcome & Opening Prayer**

Beloved in Christ, grace and peace to you on this beautiful summer Sunday!  
Today, God is calling each of us not just to sit and listen, but to rise, engage, and redeem the time He has given us. Open your hearts—the Lord is ready to do something NEW among us!

## **Scripture Foundation**

> **“Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.”**  
> — _Ephesians 5:15-16 (ESV)_

## **1. Living in the Light of Urgency**

Brothers and sisters, we know it: Time moves fast, and our world is changing by the hour.  
In Ephesians 5, Paul calls us to _“make the best use of the time,”_ for “the days are evil.”  
Look around—divisions, wars, uncertainty, and anxiety abound. Just this week, we’ve seen heartbreaking headlines about violence, political upheaval, and people searching desperately for hope. [[source](https://www.nytimes.com/section/world)]

**But God is calling His people not to panic, but to _redeem_ the time!**

#### **What does it mean to redeem the time?**

- **Be intentional**: Our days are not just to be endured, but to be invested for God’s glory.
- **Seek His purpose**: Ask, _“Lord, what would You have me do TODAY?”_
- **Live awake**: Don’t fall into spiritual slumber!

> _“So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.”_  
> — Psalm 90:12 (ESV)

## **2. Wise Living in a Chaotic Age**

You weren’t saved just to survive; you were saved to SHINE.  
Paul’s call is to look carefully at how we walk—not in aimlessness, but in WISDOM.

### **3 Marks of Wise Living:**

#### **A. Cultivate Thankfulness**

We read arguments and discouragement everywhere, but God’s people have a different spirit:

> “Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”  
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (ESV)

When you’re at work, giving thanks sets you apart. When you’re with your family, a grateful spirit changes the atmosphere. Even on social media, thankfulness is a light in the darkness.

#### **B. Pursue Holiness**

When temptation whispers, remember you are God’s temple!

> “But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct.”  
> — 1 Peter 1:15 (ESV)

God’s grace doesn’t just forgive, it EMPOWERS you to live differently—even when everyone around you chooses compromise.

#### **C. Love Boldly**

If ever our world needed real love, it’s now!  
True Christian love is _active_, _practical_, and _countercultural_.

> “By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”  
> — John 13:35 (ESV)

## **3. Today—Your Opportunity!**

Friends, **the time is now**. Revival rarely comes with thunder—often, it comes quietly, when ordinary Christians say YES to God’s call, TODAY, in their families, neighborhoods, schools, workplaces.

- **Is there someone you can pray for? DO it.**
- **Is there a wrong you need to make right? DO it.**
- **Is God asking for your time, your talents, your voice? SURRENDER them.**

> “If you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”  
> — Hebrews 3:15 (ESV)

---

## **Conclusion: The Call to Purpose & Action**

Brothers and sisters, we are not a people without hope!  
The world may be shaking, but our foundation is **JESUS**—the unchanging Rock.

> **“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.”**  
> — 2 Timothy 1:7 (ESV)

Let’s rise this July 13, 2025, and choose to be people who **redeem the times**.  
Let us walk wisely, love bravely, and live for the glory of our Lord!

---

### **Prayer of Commitment**

_Lord Jesus, awaken us to Your purposes. Help us to walk wisely, to invest our days for Your Kingdom, to love boldly in a world of fear. Give us the courage and the grace to redeem the time, that Your name would be glorified in this generation. Amen!_

### **Call to Action**

As you go from here,

- Take five minutes today to thank God for three things.
- Reach out to someone in need—call, text, pray, serve.
- Make this week count for Christ—share your faith, offer forgiveness, step into God’s adventure.

**The world is waiting. God is with you. Make today count!**

# **Amen!**
