# Sermon: “This Too Is For the Best”—Finding Hope in Grief  

---

> “Gam zu le tova” — **“this too is for the best”**

Beloved family of faith,  
Today we gather with heavy hearts. Grief has visited; loss has gripped us. When death lingers at our door, when memory’s ache makes each breath a trial, we ask, *Where is God? Where is hope?*

But the story is not over. God is not silent. Hear these promises—ancient, enduring, unbreakable. Hear God's comforting Word for the brokenhearted:

> “The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”  
> —Psalm 34:18 (ESV)

## I. **God Draws Near in Your Grief**

Right now, as tears blur your vision and memories overwhelm your soul, God is not far; He is **near**. He is the “Father of mercies and God of all comfort” (2 Corinthians 1:3). He cradles the grieving. He collects every tear (Psalm 56:8). My friend, you are not alone. God sees your pain, and He meets you right there.

## II. **Bring Your Burden to the Cross**

> “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”  
> —1 Peter 5:7

What is the burden you carry? Is it grief, regret, uncertainty about your brother’s eternal home? Bring it to Christ. Lay it at His feet, for **He cares for you**.

Don’t clutch your pain—give it to Jesus! Don’t let fear of the unknown bind your heart. Jesus died not only for the righteous, but for all—for sinners, for doubters, for the broken, for those who stumbled at the finish line.

## III. **The Gift of Grace is Greater Than All Our Fears**

> “For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.”  
> —Ephesians 2:8–9

It is not our good deeds that swing wide the gates of heaven. It is grace. God's heart is large, His mercy deep. Trust Him. Trust His goodness and love even when your understanding fails.

Listen to the words of Jesus:

> “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.”  
> —John 11:25–26

Life and death bow to the One who walked out of the grave victorious! When your heart wonders if your loved one is safe with God, remember: **Christ’s love is stronger than the grave**.

## IV. **Nothing Can Separate Us from Christ’s Love**

> “…neither death nor life…nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  
> —Romans 8:38–39

You are worried, you are afraid, but cling to this: **Nothing—NOTHING—can separate God's children from His love.** Your brother is in His hands, and His hands are full of mercy.

## V. **God’s Purpose in Pain—Gam Zu Le Tova**

The ancient teacher Nachum Ish Gamzu would say, *“Gam zu le tova.”* “This too is for the best.” It's hard to see. Grief can blind us. But listen again to the Word:

> “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”  
> —Romans 8:28

Even in our greatest loss, God is at work, weaving threads of grace and hope. Your pain is not wasted. Your questions have meaning. In your tears, God sows seeds for a future harvest. Hang on. **He is not finished with your story.**

## VI. **A Future Without Tears**

Your sadness is real. But it’s not forever.

> “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”  
> —Revelation 21:4

God Himself promises to wipe every tear. One day, every sorrow will make sense in the light of His glory.

## **Call to Action: Trust, Hope, and Love**

Beloved,  
- Mourn—yes.
- Cry—yes.
- Miss your brother—yes.
- But do not let your grief drown out hope.

Let God’s promises be your anchor. Place your worries into His hands. Trust Him with your brother, for His hands are gentle and His heart is kind.

Tonight, or tomorrow, or whenever grief presses hard, pray:  
“Father, I do not understand, but I choose to trust You. Hold me close. Hold my brother close. Let Your love be enough.”

Live every day with renewed hope. Let love and the gospel flow from your life. And if you need to talk, to pray, to weep—reach out to this church family. We are the body of Christ—NO ONE grieves alone.

**Your sorrow will turn to joy. Your questions will bow to God’s answers. Jesus is Lord of the living and the dead—trust Him today.**  

**Amen.**
