# Finding Strength in the Midst of Grief

_By Mike, a servant of the Lord_

**Dear Marissa,**

First, let me say from the depths of my heart—I am so very sorry for the loss of your dear brother, Anthony. The weight of such grief can feel unbearable, and your struggle to find strength is a natural and holy part of mourning. Today, I want to walk with you in this valley, holding up scripture as a lamp to our feet and a light to our path.

## 1. God is Near to the Brokenhearted

The Psalmist declares with reassuring certainty:

> _“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”_  
> —Psalm 34:18 (ESV)

In this moment of overwhelming sorrow, please remember: **God is not distant. He is not indifferent. He draws near to you.** You are not alone. Your pain is known to Him intimately.

## 2. This Too Is For the Best—_Gam Zu Le Tova_

There is an ancient phrase, _Gam Zu Le Tova_, meaning “this too is for the best.” It reminds us that even in moments we cannot comprehend, God’s sovereign hand works for ultimate good.

> _“And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”_  
> —Romans 8:28 (ESV)

Though it feels impossible to understand now, God’s purposes have not unraveled. Trusting Him doesn't mean the pain disappears, but it gives us a foundation to stand on amidst the storm.

## 3. The Hope of Resurrection and Eternal Life

Marissa, I know your heart yearns to know about Anthony's destiny. The assurance from Jesus Himself is life-giving:

> _“I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live...”_  
> —John 11:25 (ESV)

And:

> _“Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life... has passed from death to life.”_  
> —John 5:24 (ESV)

If Anthony came to know Jesus—if faith was his refuge—he is indeed alive with the Lord, watching over you. None of us can fully understand the mysteries of eternity, but God’s promises are steadfast.

## 4. Cast Your Anxieties on Him

In moments when your spirit feels crushed, cling to this invitation:

> _“Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”_  
> —1 Peter 5:7 (ESV)

God cares deeply about your pain. You do not have to carry it alone. Bring your fears, your doubts, your heartache to Him in prayer, and allow His peace to guard your heart.

## 5. Nothing Can Separate Us From God's Love

> _“For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”_  
> —Romans 8:38-39 (ESV)

Marissa, cling to the unbreakable love of God. In your darkest hours, His love surrounds and sustains both you and Anthony.

## 6. The Promise of an End to Pain

The day is coming when God will wipe away every tear:

> _“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore...”_  
> —Revelation 21:4 (ESV)

Hold on to this future hope—the promise of eternal joy where sorrow and pain are no more.

## A Personal Call to Action

**Marissa, I encourage you—do not walk this path alone.** Lean into your faith community, share your grief with brothers and sisters in Christ. Let the Word of God be your refuge and strength. Pray without ceasing, trusting that God is working even when you cannot see it.

**Remember, healing is a process, not a destination. Take your time. Bring your burdens to Jesus, and let Him carry them with you.**

## Closing Prayer

_Heavenly Father,  
In the midst of unbearable pain, we seek Your presence. Surround Marissa with Your comfort and peace. Help her to trust that Anthony is held safely in Your loving embrace. Strengthen her heart and guide her steps as she navigates this valley of grief. May Your promises be her anchor and Your love her strong tower. In Jesus' name, Amen._

**Dear sister in Christ, Marissa, may you feel God's loving arms around you today and always. Anthony’s spirit rests with the Lord, and you are in His divine care.**

With heartfelt prayers,  
Mike
