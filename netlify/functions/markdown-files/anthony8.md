#### Preached by Pastor Mike | June 14, 2025

### :pray: **To My Beloved Sister in Christ, Marissa**

Dear Marissa, dear friends of this hurting family of God—

Today, we come together forged in pain, wrapped in confusion, and longing for hope. Our dear sister Marissa has lost her precious brother Anthony. His fiancée has lost her unborn child. The weight is crushing, yet here you are, desperate to touch even the hem of His garment for comfort.  
Let us open our hearts, our wounds, and the living Word of God together.

## **1. God Draws Nearest When We Are Broken**

> _“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”_  
> —Psalm 34:18 (ESV)

Marissa, you are not alone in the darkness. God draws **closer** to us in loss. He doesn’t avoid your pain—He _enters_ it, He _sits_ with you in your weeping, He _cries_ with you over Anthony and the little one lost.

As the Jewish sage Nachum Ish Gamzu once taught, “**Gam zu le tova**” — _This too is for the best_. Not because the pain is good, but because God promises to bring some mysterious goodness from every pain. This is hope shining in our night.

## **2. Grief Is Not a Sign of Faithlessness—It Is An Act of Love**

Do not be ashamed of your tears. Jesus Himself wept at the tomb of Lazarus before He called him forth.

> _“Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”_  
> —1 Peter 5:7

Today, the grief feels unending. But cast your pain on Him again and again—“Lord, this is more than I can bear!”  
He hears you, and _caring for you_ is His delight.

---

## **3. The Promise: Death Does Not Have the Last Word**

> _“I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live…”_  
> —John 11:25

Our hope rests not in this fleeting life, but in Christ, whom death could not defeat!  
Marissa, hear this with your soul: Anthony’s story did not end in that moment of darkness. Christ took **all our heartbreak** to the cross. In Him, salvation is not earned by perfection, but by trusting in the completed work of Jesus.

> _“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God…”_  
> —Ephesians 2:8–9

---

## **4. Nothing Can Separate Us From God’s Love—Not Even Suicide**

Sometimes we wonder: if a life ends in tragedy, can God’s love still reach? Paul says:

> _“For I am sure that neither death nor life… nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”_  
> —Romans 8:38-39

Not even the deepest valley, the darkest decision, the most painful loss can break the grip of God’s love! This is the **scandalous mercy** of the cross. Trust His grace for Anthony. Trust His mercy for the baby. Trust His love for you.

---

## **5. Purpose in the Pain—A Call to Faithfulness**

> _“We know that for those who love God all things work together for good…”_  
> —Romans 8:28

We may not see or understand the “why.” But faith is trusting that the Gardener knows what He is doing with His most beloved vines.

God can take your heartbreak and—_in time_—use it to heal others. _Gam zu le tova_. Hold tight, Marissa! God is not done.

---

## **6. He Will Wipe Away Every Tear**

Hear this, church, as a future song for us all:

> _“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more… for the former things have passed away.”_  
> —Revelation 21:4

There will come a day when Anthony’s pain is gone, when your tears are gone, when the broken will be mended and every question will be swallowed up in the embrace of Jesus.

## :raised_hands: **Application & Call to Action**

**1. Pour out your honest heart to God—every grief, every question.**  
_Prayer is not a performance—it’s a lifeline, especially in the storm._

**2. Let the church hold you.**  
_Share your burden with this community. We were saved into a family for such a time as this._

**3. Stay in the Word when you feel adrift.**  
_These verses are your anchor. Write them down. Speak them aloud. Let them speak in the night when memories feel heaviest._

**4. When ready, walk into the pain of others.**  
_God will use your story—Anthony’s story—to bring hope and light to others in shadows. You will be God’s wounded healer, carrying resurrection hope._

---

## **Let Us Pray**

“Father of all compassion,  
You alone know the weight Marissa carries. Hold her close, closer than her tears. Speak Your hope over her life. Keep Anthony and this precious little one safe in Your arms until that great resurrection morning. Turn this valley into a place where Your glory shines brightest.  
Teach us to trust You—_gam zu le tova_—THIS, too, shall become part of Your goodness in time.  
In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

### **Remember—Your Savior is Near, Your Church is With You. Anthony’s name is not forgotten. YOU are seen, loved, and held.**

## :sparkles: **Cling to Christ. The dawn is coming.** :sparkles:

> **If you are struggling, reach out—to God, to us, to a Christian counselor or trusted friend. You are never alone.**

_With all the love of Christ,_  
**Pastor Mike**
