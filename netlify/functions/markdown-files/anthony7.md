## **Opening Prayer**

Heavenly Father,  
We come today trembling and tender, hearts heavy, eyes brimming.  
Bring Your Word to light, shine comfort into our darkness,  
and let Your love cradle Marissa, her family,  
and all of us who’ve wrestled with loss,  
who’ve asked “Why?” and found no easy answer,  
who need You so desperately, now more than ever.  
In Jesus’ name, Amen.

## **“Gam Zu LeTova”—This Too Is For the Best?**

*Marissa,*  
You’re not alone in your pain. Grief hugs you tight;  
your brother Anthony’s absence is a wound too deep for easy words.  
How do you find hope when sorrow’s shadow blocks out the sun?  
How do you rise from the valley of despair,  
especially when you’re told, “Everything happens for a reason”?  

There’s a phrase from Jewish tradition—“**Gam zu le tova**”—  
*“this too is for the best.”*  
Most days, that’s hard to hear.  
Maybe today it feels impossible.

But there’s gospel power in holding on,  
in wrestling honestly,  
and in coming to God not with perfect faith,  
but with a broken heart.

## **God Sees You—And He’s Near** 

> “The LORD is **near** to the brokenhearted  
> and saves the crushed in spirit.”  
> —*Psalm 34:18 (ESV)*

**Marissa, if you do anything today, do this:**  
Cry out to God with your tears, your anger, your confusion.  
You don’t need a mask with God.  
He *draws close* to your heartbreak.

In our world right now, so many struggle under the weight of despair.  
The pressures of life—war, jobs lost, families torn—push people to the brink.  
Yet our God never steps back. *He steps closer.*  
He *saves* the crushed in spirit!  
Your sadness does not make you “less” in His eyes;  
it draws from Him radical compassion.

---

## **Casting the Weight onto God**

> “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”  
> —*1 Peter 5:7 (ESV)*

Picture a fisherman flinging his net into deep water—  
that’s “casting.”  
God invites you not to carry your burdens alone—  
but to *throw them* upon Him.

Your questions about Anthony—  
“Is he in heaven?” “Is he watching over me?”—  
are holy, urgent questions.  
Hear Jesus’ promise:

> “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live…”  
> —*John 11:25 (ESV)*

Anthony’s story is not ended by tragedy.  
It is sealed by Jesus.  
**Salvation does not depend on a single moment,  
but on the grace of God**—stronger than our weakness,  
greater than our confusion.

## **Nothing Can Separate Us from God’s Love**

> “For I am sure that neither death nor life…nor anything else  
> in all creation, will be able to separate us  
> from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
> —*Romans 8:38–39 (ESV)*

Not fear. Not depression. **Not even death.**

We do not know every detail of what happens after death.  
What we do know is that God’s love *reaches further and deeper than our sorrow*—  
and His mercy holds those we love.

> “For by grace you have been saved through faith… it is the gift of God…”  
> —*Ephesians 2:8–9 (ESV)*

Grace is bigger than our failures. Grace is bigger than our pain.  
**Grace is big enough for Anthony. And for you, Marissa.**

## **A Hope That Does Not Die**

> “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,  
> and death shall be no more,  
> neither shall there be mourning,  
> nor crying, nor pain anymore,  
> for the former things have passed away.”
> —*Revelation 21:4 (ESV)*

**One day, God Himself will wipe away every tear.**  
He will make all things new.  
Until then: we hold each other up.  
We carry one another, as Jesus carries us.

## **A Call to Action: What Do We Do Now?**

1. **Be Vulnerable With God and Each Other**  
   Don’t hide your sorrow. Bring it to God and trusted friends.

2. **Reach Out—Don’t Isolate**
   If you’re struggling, get help. If you see others hurting, step in.  
   Let us be the hands and feet of Jesus to one another.  
   *Even this week,* mental health crises are at historic highs.  
   The body of Christ must be a place where it’s safe to ask for help.  
   *(If you or someone you know needs someone to talk to, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is always there: 988.)*

3. **Remember Anthony with Love, Not Regret**  
   Jesus remembers him, too. *Thank God for every good memory.*  
   Pray. Share stories. Laugh and cry together.

4. **Hold onto Hope: Jesus Has the Last Word**
   Death is not the end. In Christ, resurrection and reunion await.

## **A Final Word of Blessing**

Marissa, dear sister:  
*Anthony is not forgotten.*  
He is not lost to you—or to God.  
Every tear you shed is caught by the Father.

May the **peace of Christ** be your river of comfort.  
May the **hope of the resurrection** carry you through the night.  
May the **Spirit of God** strengthen, lift, and enfold you—  
until the day when, forever and always,  
**all things are made new.**

**In Jesus’ mighty name—Amen.**

### **If You Need Prayer or Support…**

Don’t walk this road alone.  
Reach out, lean on your church family,  
and trust that *even this*—  
Gam zu le tova—  
*will, in God’s mysterious mercy,*  
be woven into His story of redemption.
