# Sermon: In the Midst of Darkness, Trust in God's Hope and Grace

**Beloved brothers and sisters in Christ,**

Today, my heart comes to you heavy yet hopeful. We gather not just as a community but as a family bound by the love of Christ, especially when life deals us the hardest blows. I want to speak to those among us carrying deep sorrow—especially those wrestling with the pain of losing a loved one to suicide. I want you to know: **God sees your pain. God is near to the brokenhearted.** (Psalm 34:18)

## The Reality of Our Pain and the Promise of God's Presence

Sometimes, life’s darkest moments make us question everything. “Why did this happen? Where is God in it all? Is my loved one really safe now?” These are honest questions, and God invites us to bring them to Him.

The psalmist declares,

> “The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” — Psalm 34:18

Friends, God does not turn away from our tears or condemn our grief. He draws close. He holds us through the storm.

## Assurance for Our Loved Ones in Christ

Regarding your brother, remember the words of Jesus,

> “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live...” — John 11:25

Our hope is anchored in Christ’s victory over death. The Bible promises that those who believe in Jesus have eternal life. We cannot fully understand all the mysteries of God’s judgment and mercy, but we do know this: **Salvation is by grace through faith, not by works.** (Ephesians 2:8-9)

Jesus said,

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.” — John 5:24

God’s love is relentless. Nothing—no sin, no failure, no moment of despair—can separate us from His love.

> “For I am sure that neither death nor life...nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” — Romans 8:38-39

So take heart. God’s grace is greater than our darkest moments. Trust in His mercy for your brother, and cling to the hope that he is in the hands of a loving Savior.

## Moving Forward: Finding Hope and Purpose

Now, what of _you_—the ones left behind, aching and uncertain? The LORD calls you to cast your burdens on Him,

> “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.” — 1 Peter 5:7

Do not carry this weight alone. Let God’s peace guard your heart. Trust that He is weaving even this tragedy into His greater purpose,

> “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.” — Romans 8:28

Remember the ancient wisdom of Nachum Ish Gamzu:  
**“Gam zu le tova” — This too is for the best.** Even when we cannot see it, God is working all things toward our good.

## A Call to Action: Live in the Light of God’s Love

1. **Grieve honestly, but don’t lose hope.** Bring your pain to God and to trusted brothers and sisters.
2. **Hold fast to the promises of Scripture.** Let God’s Word be your anchor.
3. **Reach out to others who are hurting.** Your testimony can be a light in the darkness.
4. **Commit to living a life that honors God’s grace.** Let your sorrow be transformed into service and love.

## Closing Encouragement

Dear friend, hear this promise from Revelation:

> “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more...for the former things have passed away.” — Revelation 21:4

One day, every hurt will be healed, every tear wiped away. Until then, hold tightly to Jesus, the Resurrection and the Life.

Let us pray:

**Heavenly Father, we bring before You the pain of loss, the questions of our hearts, and the burdens we carry. Comfort those who mourn, especially the brother or sister who feels shattered by grief. Surround them with Your peace that surpasses understanding. We thank You for Your unfailing love and the hope we have in Christ. Help us to trust You in all things, proclaiming “Gam zu le tova” — this too is for the best. In Jesus’ name, Amen.**

**May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him. (Romans 15:13)**

Go in peace, beloved, and live in the light of His everlasting love.
