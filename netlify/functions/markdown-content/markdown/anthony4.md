# **“This Too Is for the Best” — A Sermon of Hope for the Brokenhearted**

---

> **“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”**  
> — Psalm 34:18 (ESV)

## **1. When the Night Is Dark: God Draws Near**

Marissa, and all who walk through the valley of loss: God sees you. He is not distant from your heartbreak. He does not turn away from your tears. **He is near to the brokenhearted.** Right where you are, in the depths of your grief, the Lord comes closer than ever.

When your soul is crushed and you feel like you are drowning in sorrow, **He is the lifter of your head** and the keeper of your tears.

There is no shame in your pain.

There is no weakness in leaning on God—in fact, that is where true strength is found!

## **2. “Gam zu le tova” — This Too Is for the Best?**

You have heard the saying: *“Gam zu le tova”—“This too is for the best.”* Sometimes, those words feel impossible. How can the loss of a beloved brother, Anthony, ever be for the best?

Beloved, God is not the author of evil. He grieves with you. But our faith clings to the unshakeable promise:

> **“And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”**  
> — Romans 8:28 (ESV)

It doesn’t mean every tragedy is itself good, but **God is able to take even the worst pain and redeem it.** There is no darkness so deep that His love cannot reach in and shine light.

## **3. Grief, Questions, and God’s Unfailing Love**

Your grief is real. Your questions are valid. “Why, Lord? Where is Anthony now? Will I ever be whole again?”

Let’s remember:

- **1 Peter 5:7:**  
  > *“Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”*

Marissa, pour out your heart. God welcomes your tears, your confusion, your anger. **He cares for you** more than words can express.

And our hope for Anthony is grounded in **the love and mercy of Jesus:**

- **John 11:25-26:**  
  > *“I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.”*

We trust in God’s mercy and leave our loved ones in His hands. Your hope is not in your understanding of the situation, but in God’s immense love and grace—greater than any of us can comprehend.

## **4. The Strongest Anchor: Christ’s Unbreakable Promise**

When our hearts accuse us, **hear again the promise**:

- **Romans 8:38-39:**  
  > *“For I am sure that neither death nor life ... nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”*

Death cannot separate Anthony from God’s love. Nor you. Nor me.

Our salvation is by **grace**, not by the strength of our faith, nor the perfection of our walk:

- **Ephesians 2:8-9:**  
  > *“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God ...”*

---

## **5. Hope for the Future—and for Today**

This is not the end of the story. **Revelation 21:4** promises us:

> *“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more ...”*

Anthony’s story continues in the eternal, merciful hands of God. Your story is cradled there too.

## **6. What Now? The Call to Cast Your Life on Him**

Marissa, and beloved in Christ:  
- Hold nothing back from God—bring Him your pain, your doubts, your hope.
- Let your heart rest in His embrace, where Anthony now rests as well.
- Cry out, “Lord, carry me!”—and He will.

**He offers you His presence, His comfort, and the sure hope of reunion and resurrection.**

Let us pray together:

---

### **Prayer**

*Father,  
We come broken, mourning, with empty hands. We lift Anthony to your mercy, trusting in your love that is stronger than death. Hold Marissa close, wrap her in your arms. Turn our tears into hope, our grief into deeper faith, and our questions into trust. May Anthony rest in your glorious presence. May our hearts find peace in your promise that nothing, not even death, can separate us from your love. In Christ’s name, Amen.*

## **Go Forth: Hope Holds Fast**

Marissa, you are seen, loved, and carried by the Lord. He will never let you go. Let your sorrow draw you nearer to His heart.

If you feel alone, reach out to trusted friends, pastors, or counselors. The Church is here to walk with you. **Let others pray with you and bear your burden.**

**Let your heart say, “Lord, I believe—help my unbelief!” And know that even in the darkness, Jesus is with you.** There is nothing, not even death or despair, that can separate you from His love.

*Anthony is in the hands of the Shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine to find the one. Rest your hope in that Good Shepherd, and He will bring you through.*

**Amen and amen.**
